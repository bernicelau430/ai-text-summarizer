- Justine Henin-Hardenne lost to Elena Dementieva in a comeback exhibition match in Belgium on Sunday for her second defeat in two days.
- After an initial lay-off, she was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the French Open in the second round.
- I have to be positive, I still have a few weeks, she said.
- Now it's time to get back to putting in 200% effort and I think I am capable of doing that.
- Henin-Hardenne was speaking after a 6-2 5-7 6-2 loss to world number six Dementieva in Charleroi, Belgium, on Sunday.
- But I think there'll be less pressure than last time even if I am champion.
