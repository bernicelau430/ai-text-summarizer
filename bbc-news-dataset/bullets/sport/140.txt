- Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate has branded Chelsea's expected complaint to Uefa as "pathetic".
- Rijkaard was critical of Mourinho's decision not to speak to the media after the match.
- Mourinho lied with the line-ups, and now this.
- The source of Chelsea's anger was an alleged talk between Barca boss Frank Rijkaard and referee Anders Frisk, who later dismissed Didier Drogba.
- The referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to Uefa.
- The only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that Chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference.
- Frisk says Rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game.
