- Coyne, Jones, Roberts, Collins, Edwards, Gabbidon, Page, Partridge, Ricketts, Roberts, Weston, Davies, Fletcher, Giggs, Koumas, Robinson, Savage, Williams, Bellamy, Earnshaw, and Hartson are on the Wales team.
- There are doubts about Gabbidon, Roberts, Giggs, and Savage because of hamstring concerns and a groin injury.
- Williams is out with an ankle injury, so Roberts was drafted in.
