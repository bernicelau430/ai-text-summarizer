- La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best
- Connors was impressed with the coaches and the way the kids went about their workouts
- We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship
- Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved
- It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them
- The relationship that Jimmy's already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it
- Former world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman
- Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can't buy
