- Former world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.
- The American spent three days at the LTA's annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week.
- La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best.
- It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them.
- We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.
