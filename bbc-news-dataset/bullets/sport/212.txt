- Walter Smith was named as the new Scotland manager.
- Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents.
- Smith was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup and won seven league titles with Rangers.
- It remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work.
