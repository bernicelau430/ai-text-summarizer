- Mido apologized to rejoin the Egyptian national team.
- He came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologize for all his mistakes.
- No one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologize.
- It's not his right to give orders and say when he wants to play, and will always make sure that he put the national's team's matches as his top priority.
- Mido's apology today does not negatively affect Mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players.
