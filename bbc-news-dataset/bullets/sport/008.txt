- Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury.
- Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event.
- There was a problem with the wound healing that set back her rehabilitation by about two months.
- Moore is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, possibly for the Commonwealth Games next March.
