- Switzerland, Ireland, France, and Israel are tied on five points from three matches.
- Ireland has a slight edge after claiming away draws in Basel and Paris.
- The defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks.
- Stephen Carr and Finnan contributed well on Ireland's right flank.
- In Basel we did not play great football, but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game.
