- Matt Williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping Scottish rugby.
- Williams wants to make it clear that he's committed totally to Scottish rugby.
- Williams said the national team is separate to the political situation.
- Williams said the idea that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of Scottish rugby is simply not the case.
- There must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within Scottish rugby.
- Williams said the national team attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team.
- That means they will have 91 days away from their club from July until the Six Nations.
