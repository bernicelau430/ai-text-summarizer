- Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles was great.
- A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance.
- It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.
- There could be half a dozen medal prospects at the European Championships.
