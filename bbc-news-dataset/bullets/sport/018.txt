- Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.
- His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game.
- Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff.
- Physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well, Jones said.
- Jones added: I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it.
- He was confident and fancied it.
