- Mido said that it is not his right to give orders and say when he wants to play, and he will always make sure that he puts the national team's matches as his top priority.
- Shalaby said that Mido's apology does not negatively affect Mido in any way; on the contrary, it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players.
