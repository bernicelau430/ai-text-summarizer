- Juninho has not come through the Celtic ranks and deserves respect
- Could reconsider his future at Celtic if not given more games by end of January
- Celtic has always been this way and that is certainly the case at Celtic Park
- Spoken with Juninho, and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination
- Signed from Middlesbrough but has failed to meet high expectations
- Veracruz hopes to sign Juninho if he leaves Celtic due to lack of play time
- Mexico would not be his preferred destination
