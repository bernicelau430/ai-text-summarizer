- Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.
- Connors spent three days at the LTA's annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week.
- La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best.
- It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them.
- The relationship that Jimmy's already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it.
- Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved.
- Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can't buy.
- What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had.
