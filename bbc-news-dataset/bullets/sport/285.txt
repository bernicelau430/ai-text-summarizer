- England tight-head prop Phil Vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the 2005 RBS Six Nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm.
- Vickery was injured as his club side, Gloucester, beat Bath 17-16 in the West country derby on Saturday.
- Gloucester prop was only recalled after Leicester tight-head Julian White suffered a neck injury which has already seen him ruled out of the Ireland game.
- Bath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England's training squad and could be involved against Ireland.
- The news is just the latest blow for coach Andy Robinson, who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the 2005 Six Nations.
- Bath centre Olly Barkley sat out the derby due to a leg injury.
- Barkley will have a scan on Sunday and might miss England's trip to Six Nations leaders Ireland next weekend.
