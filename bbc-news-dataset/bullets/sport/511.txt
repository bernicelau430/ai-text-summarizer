- Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.
- Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.
- Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues' push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena.
- I felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.
