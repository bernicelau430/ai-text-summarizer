- Shalaby earlier said that after an apology Mido would be available for the national side if coach Hassan Shehata chose him
- Mido came to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all his mistakes
- Mido's apology today does not negatively affect Mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players
- Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise
- Mido added that it's not his right to give orders and say when he wants to play, but he will always make sure that he puts the national's team's matches as his top priority
