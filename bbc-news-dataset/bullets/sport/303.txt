- Stephen Jones was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.
- Jones knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than him.
- Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff.
- Henson's defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game.
