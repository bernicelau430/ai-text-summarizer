- Wales captain Gareth Thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations with a broken thumb.
- Wales can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years.
- Wales travel to Edinburgh to take on Scotland in a fortnight and then host Ireland in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider.
- Thomas did a great job in the second half in France.
- Had they been ruthless, Wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down.
- The character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.
- Michael Owen will be our captain.
