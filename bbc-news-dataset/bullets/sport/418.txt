- Henin-Hardenne lost to Elena Dementieva in a comeback exhibition match
- Second defeat in two days
- Slid down the world rankings after contracting an illness
- Was forced off the circuit for a second time after being knocked out of the French Open
- Now it's time to get back to putting in 200% effort and I think I am capable of doing that
- I have to be positive, I still have a few weeks
- I think there'll be less pressure than last time even if I am champion
