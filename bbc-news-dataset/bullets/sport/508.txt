- Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a victory against Italy.
- Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.
- The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.
- An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie crossed for a converted try.
- A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks.
