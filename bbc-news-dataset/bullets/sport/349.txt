- Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.
- Connors spent three days at the LTA's annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga.
- It was interesting to see kids with that desire and passion.
- Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can't buy.
- The relationship that Jimmy has already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it.
- Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved.
- They want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and they hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.
