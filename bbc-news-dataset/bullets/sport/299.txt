- England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.
- Robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday's set-to with France at Twickenham.
- Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour.
- Barkley is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.
- It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way.
- The midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat.
- Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy.
- Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test.
