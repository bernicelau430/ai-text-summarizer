- Jones was happy to hand Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England
- Knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me
- The sort of player who likes pressure on me
- Confident and fancied it
- I set a high standard against England and I've got to back it up next week
- Defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game
