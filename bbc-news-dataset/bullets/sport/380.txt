- Ireland defeated Argentina with a late drop goal by Ronan O'Gara.
- Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty.
- O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later.
- Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.
