- La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best.
- What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had.
- We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.
- Speaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport that Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved.
