- Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.
- O'Sullivan said Andy was sitting two yards from him and he couldn't see whether he was offside or not so he doesn't know how Andy could have known.
- O'Sullivan said their try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as they have scored for a while.
- O'Sullivan said England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for them.
- Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll said they are delighted, they felt if they performed well then they would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter.
- O'Driscoll said his try was a move they had worked on all week.
- Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over England as a special win.
- Byrne said it was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in their team they worked really, really hard.
