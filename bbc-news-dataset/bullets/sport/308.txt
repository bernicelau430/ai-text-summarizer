- Jones was a nice general for his side
- Hogg and White had robust games
- D'Arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but a Henson, D'Arcy, O'Driscoll combination could be good in the Lions midfield
- Henson staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend
- Cusiter looked very lively and could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward
- Jones looks a better bet than Hodgson after Saturday's game
