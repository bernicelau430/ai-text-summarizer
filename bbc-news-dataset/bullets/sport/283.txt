- Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were 'robbed' at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.
- Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay.
- Jol added: "We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal."
- Wenger said the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.
- Wenger said that it just reinforces what he feels that there should be video evidence.
- Wenger suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.
- Mendes said his reaction on the pitch was to celebrate.
- Mendes is annoyed that in 2005, the referee isn't told about the incident after watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring.
