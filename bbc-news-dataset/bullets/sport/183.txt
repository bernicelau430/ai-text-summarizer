- Ahmed 'Mido' Hossam has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.
- Mido said all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes.
- Egypt FA spokesman Methat Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise.
- Mido added: It's not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national's team's matches as my top priority.
- Shalaby said Mido's apology makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players.
- Shalaby earlier said that after an apology Mido would be available for the national side if coach Hassan Shehata chose him.
