- Jones was happy to hail Henson's heroic contribution to Wales' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993
- Jones knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me
- He was confident and fancied it
- I'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me
- Physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well
- Jones set a high standard against England and he's got to back it up next week
- His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game
- Jones was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England
- Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn't involved and we lost, so we've got to put that right next week
