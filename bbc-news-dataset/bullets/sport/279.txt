- Jones was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.
- He was confident and fancied it.
- The percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me.
- Jones knew he was going to struggle to make it.
- I said to Gareth (Thomas, the Wales captain) 'This is touch and go.
- Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal.
- Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn't involved and we lost, so we've got to put that right next week.
- Jones said I set a high standard against England and I've got to back it up next week.
- Physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well.
- His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game.
- I'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me.
