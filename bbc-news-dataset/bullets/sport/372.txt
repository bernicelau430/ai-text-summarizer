- The International Rugby Board will discuss a plan for a global integrated season next month.
- The season would start with the Celtic League in October.
- The Heineken Cup would be in February and March.
- The Six Nations would be moved to April and May.
- Spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation.
- Sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully, the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure.
