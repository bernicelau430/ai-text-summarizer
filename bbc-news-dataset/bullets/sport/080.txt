- Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.
- Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March.
- Robben knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena.
- Robben felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.
- Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday.
- This is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months.
