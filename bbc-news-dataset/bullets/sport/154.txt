- Jo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.
- She was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track.
- It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season.
