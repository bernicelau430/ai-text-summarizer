- Ruddock is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.
- The Ospreys and Scarlets say they are happy to support the Wales cause, but the Dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in Friday's game with Ulster.
- The majority of Ireland and Scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.
- Ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest, and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.
- Once we're in the Six Nations, the players will only be released in his and the WRU's best interests.
- And the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.
- Ceri Sweeney, Gareth Cooper, Ian Gough and Kevin Morgan have been used sparingly by Ruddock in the opening two Six Nations wins.
