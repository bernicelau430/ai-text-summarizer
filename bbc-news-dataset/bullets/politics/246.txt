- Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas.
- The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.
- The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.
- The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.
- The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.
- The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.
