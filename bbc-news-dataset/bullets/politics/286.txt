- UKIP has suspended a candidate, Mr. Houston, for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.
- Peter Nielson, who is UKIP Scotland chairman, said he had suspended Mr. Houston.
- UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr. Houston knew nothing of his views.
- Mr. Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr. Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.
