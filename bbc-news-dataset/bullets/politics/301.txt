- Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.
- Kennedy said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners.
- The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax.
- The Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises.
- There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the "polluter who pays".
