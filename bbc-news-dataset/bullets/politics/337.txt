- Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.
- But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.
- The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.
- A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.
