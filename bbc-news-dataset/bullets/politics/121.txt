- University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
- The research says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003.
- The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
- Road safety head Andrew Howard said it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.
- Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties.
- The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving.
- These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties.
- It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system.
