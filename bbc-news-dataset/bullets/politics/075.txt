- Ken Livingstone should stick to his guns and not apologize for his Nazi comment to a Jewish reporter, Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted.
- The prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.
- Mr Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was an attempt to reassure Jewish voters.
- Mr Johnson apologized last October for perpetuating an outdated stereotype of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley.
- Labour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologize even if Mr Blair asked.
