- Schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.
- Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school.
- Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics.
- In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved.
- Previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school.
- Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme.
