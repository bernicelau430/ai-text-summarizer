- This is about the "prisoner's dilemma".
- The sheriff needs a confession from at least one prisoner to convict them.
- Each prisoner is told separately that if they confess and are the only one to confess, they will be let off.
- If neither confesses, the sheriff cannot convict them.
- If both confess, both are convicted.
- The best outcome for both prisoners is to remain silent, but the individual incentive is to confess.
- This relates to arguments and prolonging them.
