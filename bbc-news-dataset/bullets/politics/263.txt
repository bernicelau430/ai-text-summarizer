- The sheriff presents two prisoners with a dilemma.
- If one confesses and the other doesn't, the confessor is released, and the other gets life.
- If both confess, both are convicted.
- The best individual logic is to confess, but both would be better off if they stayed silent.
- Each participant wants the argument to stop, but wants to have the last word.
- This is the "prisoner's dilemma."
