- Labour's election chief Alan Milburn has defended his party's campaign posters amid Tory claims the ads were nothing short of "sly anti-Semitism".
- The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labour's website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5.
- Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.
- The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.
