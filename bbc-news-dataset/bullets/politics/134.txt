- Hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting.
- We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again, hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said.
- Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.
