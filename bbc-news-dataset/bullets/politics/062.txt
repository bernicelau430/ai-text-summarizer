- MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said Tuesday's event is not anti-party in particular, it's anti-policy.
- Last year MAB urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections because they opposed the war in Iraq.
- Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK, and economic, social and education problems.
- The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire.
- The Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.
- The aim is to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly.
- There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.
- The war in Iraq would be a significant factor affecting Muslims' voting intentions.
- If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country.
