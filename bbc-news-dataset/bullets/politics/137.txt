- Thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in England and Wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.
- Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.
- Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed.
- Several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt, with 150 on horseback.
- The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was impossibly difficult to determine and open to different interpretations.
- Police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs.
