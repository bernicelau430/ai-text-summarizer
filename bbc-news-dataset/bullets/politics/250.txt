- A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.
- We want to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.
- We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.
- Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.
- If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.
- We've called for the state pension to be increased from £79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £105.45.
- The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.
