- Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.
- Existing adult learners could use their enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge to attract other people.
- The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year.
- The participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007.
