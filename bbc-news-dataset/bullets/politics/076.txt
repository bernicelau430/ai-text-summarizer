- A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year.
- The total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned.
- The same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, were responsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay.
- This year's overspend was significantly less than last year's £3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.
- Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown, but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects.
