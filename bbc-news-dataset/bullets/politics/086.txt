- The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.
- Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.
- They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.
- Households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500.
- The party says it would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s.
- The Liberal Democrats want to switch to a local income tax.
