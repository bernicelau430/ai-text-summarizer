- EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.
- Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.
- There were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002.
- Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community.
