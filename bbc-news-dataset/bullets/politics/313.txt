- University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
- The research says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003.
- The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
- Ministers do not support a lower limit.
