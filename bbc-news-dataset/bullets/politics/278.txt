- Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital.
- The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it.
- The Green Party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in Edinburgh's transport referendum.
- Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters.
- Residents who have opted out of the edited list could miss the chance to vote.
