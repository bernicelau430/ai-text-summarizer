- Home Secretary Charles Clarke's house arrest plans for terror suspects are facing their first Parliament test.
- Mr. Clarke states these powers are necessary to combat terror threats.
- The new powers would apply to both British and foreign terror suspects, replacing existing laws to address Law Lords' concerns.
- Tories and Lib Dems have jointly opposed the bill, deeming the house arrest plans "excessive".
- Concerns raised over the Home Secretary's initial authority to impose control orders, bypassing a judge.
- The bill proposes "control orders" for house arrest (most serious cases), curfews, electronic tagging, and communication restrictions.
- Opposition MPs are displeased with the limited two-day debate period before the plans move to the House of Lords.
- Mr. Clarke defends the measures, citing support from security services and police, warning against ignoring their advice.
