- Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.
- They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act.
- One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.
- The men's solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.
- Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder.
- The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted.
