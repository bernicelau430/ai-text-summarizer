- University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
- The research says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads.
- Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties.
- The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
- The plans include a staggered speeding fines and points system.
- Road safety head Andrew Howard said: "It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut."
- The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving.
