- Tony Blair was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget.
- Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said the Tory sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.
- Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes.
- Mr Blair derided Tory claims they could cut Â£35bn in "wasteful spending" saying the party had got its sums wrong.
- Mr Howard told MPs that "every independent expert" suggested the "government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes".
