- New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to pause for thought from Charles Kennedy.
- The Home Office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.
- The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr. Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.
