- High death rate in prisons amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group.
- One prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003.
- Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.
- Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had "presented themselves" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended.
- Misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems.
- Deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives.
- Those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.
