- The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners.
- Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.
- Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500.
