- New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to "pause for thought" from Charles Kennedy.
- The Home Office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.
- He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors.
- Mr. Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but legislation had already been "significantly influenced" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.
