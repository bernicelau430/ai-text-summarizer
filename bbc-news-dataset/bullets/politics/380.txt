- The increase in minimum wage is a good thing.
- I thank Mr. Blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.
- The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses
- I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.
- The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.
