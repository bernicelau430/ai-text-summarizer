- They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a ceiling on what the richest pay.
- Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500.
- The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax.
