- The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's "golden rule" had "turned to dross in his hands" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn.
- Mr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt "low and sustainable" - both in this economic cycle and the next.
- Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget.
- BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.
- Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.
