- Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act
- Chasing away unwanted animals was "not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004"
- If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them
- New law banning hunting with dogs is "so poorly drafted" no-one can define the offence
- He asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed
- Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting
