- The Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners hardest hit by council tax increases.
- Labour says it wants to retain and reform the property-based tax to make it fairer, and says there is scope for councils to be more efficient.
- They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a "ceiling" on what the richest pay.
- It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement.
- They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.
- Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500.
- The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland.
