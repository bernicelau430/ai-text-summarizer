- Doug Smith's departure was announced by Work Secretary Alan Johnson on 17 November as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance.
- In November, when he surprised MPs and the watching media by announcing Mr Smith's departure, Mr Johnson said Doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead.
- Lib Dem Sir Archy Kirkwood said that when Mr Johnson had announced Mr Smith was going he got the clear impression the CSA chief was retiring.
- Tory work and pensions spokesman David Willetts said families affected by CSA failings would wonder why Mr Smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced.
- Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's World at One he thought it was a non-story.
