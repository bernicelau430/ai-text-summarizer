- Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.
- They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them.
- And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.
- Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a "regressive" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.
- Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".
