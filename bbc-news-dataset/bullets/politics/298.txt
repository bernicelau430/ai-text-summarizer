- A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.
- The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash.
- The commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under Â£200.
- The report says there are still public suspicions even though the rules have been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties.
