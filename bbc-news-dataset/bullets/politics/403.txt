- The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget.
- But Mr. Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes.
- Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.
- Mr. Howard told MPs that every independent expert had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes.
