- Public trust in taxes is breaking down because Labour and Tories are not being straight with people on the issue, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.
- Mr Kennedy said: That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.
- The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax.
