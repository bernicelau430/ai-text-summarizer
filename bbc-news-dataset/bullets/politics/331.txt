- Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.
- Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.
- Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood.
- The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: "I can spend the same money twice."
- There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members.
