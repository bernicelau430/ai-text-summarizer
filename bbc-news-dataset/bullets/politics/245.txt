- The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry.
- Speaking in Scotland last week, Mr Blair hinted that a super regiment was likely.
- Speaking ahead of the expected Army Board meeting, a spokesman said: The government and the Army Board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the Scottish regiments are for the good of the Army and for that of the serving soldier.
