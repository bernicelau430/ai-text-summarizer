- Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted that Ken Livingstone should "stick to his guns" and not apologize for his "Nazi" comment to a Jewish reporter.
- Mr. Johnson, who was forced to apologize last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair "should butt out of" the row.
- Labour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologize even if Mr Blair asked.
- Mr. Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was "an attempt to reassure Jewish voters".
