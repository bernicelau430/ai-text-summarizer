- New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to "pause for thought" from Charles Kennedy.
- The Home Office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.
- The first cards would be issued in 2008.
- Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr. Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.
- Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate.
