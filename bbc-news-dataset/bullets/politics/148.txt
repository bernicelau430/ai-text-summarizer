- Two prisoners are given the "prisoner's dilemma"
- The sheriff needs at least one confession to convict the prisoners
- Each prisoner is told if they confess and are the only one, they will be let off.
- If your partner confesses, you better confess so you don't get life.
- If your partner doesn't confess, you get off completely
- If you both confess, the sheriff doesn't have to let you go.
- Both prisoners confess, even though they would have been better if they had stayed quiet.
- Successive attempts to have the last word, make the argument go on and on
