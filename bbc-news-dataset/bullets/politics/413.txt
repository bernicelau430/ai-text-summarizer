- Ken Livingstone should "stick to his guns" and not apologise for his "Nazi" comment to a Jewish reporter, Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted.
- Johnson said Mr. Blair "should butt out of" the row.
- Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an "outdated stereotype" of Liverpool.
- Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was "an attempt to reassure Jewish voters".
- Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist.
