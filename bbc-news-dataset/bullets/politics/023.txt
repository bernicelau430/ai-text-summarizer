- UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money.
- The e-University was scrapped last year.
- Only 900 students at a cost of Â£50m.
- The government said the e-University project had improved understanding.
- The e-University had too much freedom to spend public money.
- The government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but should learn the lessons from this disaster.
- UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.
