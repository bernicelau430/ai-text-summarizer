- Labour MP Stephen Pound has told of his shock and his joy on learning he fathered a daughter when he was 'out of control' during the 'wild' 1960s.
- Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr. Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as 'Precious' at school.
- Despite being told he was a 'nutter who died at sea' she found a reference to Mr. Pound on Friends Reunited.
- His first reaction was to wonder if he was victim of a 'set-up' but he then realised all the dates fitted.
- 'I was a nutter and I was a sailor but I wasn't dead.'
- 'I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.'
- 'I was pretty much out of control.'
