- This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it's anti-policy, it's on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on, MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday's event.
- There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.
- If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country, Dr Tamimi said.
