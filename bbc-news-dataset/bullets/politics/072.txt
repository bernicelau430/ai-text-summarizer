- MPs voted in favor of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour's majority was reduced to 14.
- Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians.
- The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals.
- The government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 March, when the current powers expire.
