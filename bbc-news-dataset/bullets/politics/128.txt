- Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.
- Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics.
- Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget.
- The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's golden rule had turned to dross in his hands and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn.
- BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.
