- Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.
- Mr. Howard said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".
- Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a "regressive" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.
- Mr. Howard said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr. Davis would "set out the position very clearly" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.
