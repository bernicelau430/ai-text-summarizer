- Michael Howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial Labour plans to introduce ID cards.
- He said the police had said ID cards could "help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives".
- He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would "set out the position very clearly" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.
- Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary.
- And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected.
