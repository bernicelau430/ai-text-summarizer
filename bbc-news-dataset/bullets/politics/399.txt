- New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards.
- People will pay Â£85 for a passport and ID card together or a fee for a separate ID card.
- The first cards would be issued in 2008.
- Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards.
- Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet.
- Legislation had already been "significantly influenced" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.
