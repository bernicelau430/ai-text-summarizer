- Michael Howard has dismissed fears from some Conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest.
- Voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes.
- The Tories highlighted £35bn in "wasteful" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services.
- It is perfectly true that I am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.
- But the Tories are in turn demanding that Tony Blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.
- I would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts.
