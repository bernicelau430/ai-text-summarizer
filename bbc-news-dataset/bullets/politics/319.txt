- Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.
- Labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.
- They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain.
- Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500.
- The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland.
