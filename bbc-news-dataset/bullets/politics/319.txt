- A group of MPs has tried to raise the pressure on Tony Blair over reform to the House of Lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.
- The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected.
- Their plan would see the House of Lords being renamed the Second Chamber of Parliament, and its members would be known as MSCPs.
- There would be 385 MSCPs, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops.
