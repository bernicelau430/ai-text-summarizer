- The Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax.
- The Tories say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain.
- Households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of £500.
- The party says it would aim for a £5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a £7,000 allowance for the over-65s.
