- University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
- These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties.
- It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over.
- The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving.
- Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties.
