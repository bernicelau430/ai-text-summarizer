- UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban.
- Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten.
- Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.
- What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted.
