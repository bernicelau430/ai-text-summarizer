- New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.
- The new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.
- Non-EU nationals intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'.
- The new rules were "not proportionate" and "discriminatory".
- Registrars welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be a significant deterrent.
- Significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced disproportionate restrictions.
- JCWI will be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and will be looking at taking a case to the Human Rights Court.
