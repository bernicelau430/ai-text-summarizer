- Tory MP Boris Johnson has insisted Ken Livingstone should "stick to his guns" and not apologise for his "Nazi" comment to a Jewish reporter.
- Labour's Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.
- Mr Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an "outdated stereotype" of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley.
- Mr Johnson also claimed Tony Blair's intervention in the row was "an attempt to reassure Jewish voters".
