- University College London research claims cutting the drink-drive limit from 80mg to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.
- Cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003.
- The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit.
- Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties.
- The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving.
- These have been criticized by road safety campaigners.
