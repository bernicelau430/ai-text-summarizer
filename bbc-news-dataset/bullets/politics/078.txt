- The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.
- The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.
- The plan is to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.
- Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned.
- The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.
