- Mr Livingstone "should have withdrawn the comment immediately" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair.
- Mr Blair also distanced himself from recent Labour campaign posters featuring Mr Howard, which critics claimed were "anti-Semitic".
- These were "not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community," Mr Blair insisted.
- One poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs.
- Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper.
