- Mr. Wong, blind since age seven, developed software that turns colors into musical notes to read weather maps.
- He believes having a "color memory" makes the software more useful than to scientists without prior vision.
- The software is not yet commercially available and needs collaborative effort to be viable.
- The software helps blind scientists to read color images.
- Mr. Wong translated individual colors into music with the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student.
- He needed to explore minute fluctuations to create mathematical models for studying "space weather".
- He tested a prototype version of the software on a photograph of a parrot.
