- Mobile games have come a long way in a very short time.
- Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile.
- A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology.
- Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics.
- Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in.
