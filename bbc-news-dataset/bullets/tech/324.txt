- The EFF has asked California's Superior Court to stop Apple from pursuing the sources of reporters.
- The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a Californian court to get journalists to reveal sources for articles published on AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.
- Apple is keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications.
- Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails.
- The EFF has gained powerful allies, including Professor Tom Goldstein and Dan Gillmor.
