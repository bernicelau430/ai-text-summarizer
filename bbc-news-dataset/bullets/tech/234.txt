- It's important for mobile phone operators to get users to send multimedia messages (MMS).
- Sending MMS offsets the cost of subsidizing handsets.
- The problem is educating people on how to send MMS using their handsets.
- Mobile phone operators cap the number of messages to prevent overwhelming the system.
- Multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones, increasing reluctance.
- 36% of British camera phone users have never sent an MMS, up from 7% in 2003.
- Research indicates people don't send MMS because they don't know how.
- The MMS sending rate into the mobile network is fairly constant.
- Systems getting people used to seeing phones as devices that handle different content are useful.
- Networks can see dramatic results when they find a good way to get multimedia to customers.
- The number of MMS messages is capped to avoid swamping narrow channels.
