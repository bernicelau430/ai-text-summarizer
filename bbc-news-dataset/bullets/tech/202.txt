- A Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs.
- Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.
- The Live-Shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session.
- Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas.
- The RSPCA said it had "grave concerns" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.
- Mike Berger, wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting.
