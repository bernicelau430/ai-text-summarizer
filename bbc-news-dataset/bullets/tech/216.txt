- One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR).
- Networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.
- DirectTV has launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.
- The way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers.
- All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.
- These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.
