- A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers.
- The Internationalised Domain Names system has recently been approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force.
- Registering names that look like legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers.
- A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system.
- The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'.
- But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.
- The fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent.
