- ScanSoft and Gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control.
- They want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move.
- Users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor's name.
