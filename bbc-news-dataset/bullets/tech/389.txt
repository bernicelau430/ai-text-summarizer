- Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.
- The problem is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.
- Mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.
- The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them.
- 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS).
- People are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.
- The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant.
- Networks cap the number of MMS messages to avoid swamping channels.
