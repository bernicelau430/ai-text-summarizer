- Blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio.
- Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels.
- Mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.
- A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months.
- Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog.
