- Google released a trial tool called AutoLink that directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.
- If a user clicks AutoLink in the Google toolbar, a webpage with a book's ISBN number links directly to Amazon's website.
- Some users want websites to sign up for AutoLink or receive revenue for click-throughs.
- Google said none of the linked companies paid for the service.
- Google stated the feature is in beta and welcomes user feedback.
- Users can choose to disable AutoLink entirely.
