- In most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour.
- HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now.
- The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the true impact of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice.
- There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra.
- The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.
