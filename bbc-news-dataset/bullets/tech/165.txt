- Controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.
- A wireless cap was demonstrated that read brain waves to control a computer character.
- Four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.
- The research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.
- Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.
