- EduVision is using low-cost computer systems to provide up-to-date information to students in Africa.
- The E-slates connect wirelessly to a base station in the school.
- The base station processes satellite transmissions into a readable format for the E-slates.
- EduVision plans to use solar panels to power the base station and allow students to charge E-slates at school and use them at home.
- The system is simple to set up but currently uses a one-way connection, making feedback difficult.
- EduVision plans to expand the system to more remote regions and include audio and video files.
