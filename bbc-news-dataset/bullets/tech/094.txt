- An organization has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, thanks to innovations.
- Roy Tansley developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.
- The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal.
- In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT.
