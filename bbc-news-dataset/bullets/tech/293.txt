- Currently only a Windows version of the software was in development.
- Future versions are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system.
- This lets moderators prove who they are to the network.
- It also lets them rate which files are worth downloading.
- Exeem will combine ideas from BitTorrent and Kazaa.
- Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.
- It would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova.
- This is because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.
- When big files were being shared moderation systems were key.
- The rating system in Exeem seems flawed.
- It is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings.
- This should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.
- Moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa.
- Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped.
- This should help stop the spread of fake files.
- Exeem cannot prevent pollution.
- Costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.
- One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software.
