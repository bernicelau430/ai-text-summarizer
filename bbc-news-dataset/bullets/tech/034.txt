- The UK government is launching a rapid alerting service for home computer users about internet security problems.
- The service will be run by the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).
- Alerts will cover serious threats affecting potentially millions of people, explaining the problem, its impact, and how to avoid trouble.
- The service will also occasionally send advice on safe computer and phone usage.
- The service will direct people to security firms for patches.
- The NISCC stresses the importance of using anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates in addition to the alerting service.
- Other similar services include the National Alerting Service for the Netherlands and the US National Cyber Alerting Service.
