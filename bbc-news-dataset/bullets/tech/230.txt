- Transport for London (TfL) is using posters with hypertags for its Safe Travel at Night campaign.
- Posters provide information about the safest route home when interrogated with a mobile phone.
- Posters automatically beam information to phones with IR ports held close to the icon.
- Posters work outside mobile phone networks.
- Hypertags can pass on almost any form of data, including images, ring tones, and video clips.
- Infra-red technology was chosen because many phones have IR ports.
- No figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign racked up 12,500 interactions.
- The TfL campaign will run until Boxing Day.
