- The Cell processor is different from traditional computers, which use a single processor.
- Cell uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.
- The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance.
- The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems.
- Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console.
- If Cell succeeds, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future.
- Traditional computers use a single processor.
- Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power.
- Sony hopes the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room.
- Intel will be working on new designs to address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell.
- Microsoft and Intel are not going to let Cell take over home computing without a fight.
