- Consumer electronics companies want UWB to replace cables and simplify set-up.
- Intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (UWB).
- Intel says the benefit of UWB is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi, wimax and mobile phone networks.
- Intel announced that two UWB groups, WiMedia Alliance and Multi-band OFDM alliance had merged to support the technology.
- UWB is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless USB devices which need low power consumption.
