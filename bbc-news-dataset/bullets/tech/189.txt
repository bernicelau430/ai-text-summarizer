- Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites
- Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail.
- Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann.
- By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity.
