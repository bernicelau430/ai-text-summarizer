- But just as the World Wide Web was the "killer application" that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3G adoption.
- 3G phones and iPods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket.
- But 3G networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net-based IP services.
- It is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling.
