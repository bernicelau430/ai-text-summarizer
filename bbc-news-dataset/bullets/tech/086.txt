- Writing a Microsoft Word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm Workshare.
- Up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed, a survey by the firm revealed.
- Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers.
- The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes.
