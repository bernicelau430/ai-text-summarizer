- Surfers outside the US have been unable to visit the official re-election site of President George W Bush.
- Since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney failed.
- On 21 October, the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.
- The site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US.
- The blocking of browsers sited outside the US began in the early hours of Monday morning.
