- Nicholas Negroponte is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).
- He wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.
- He said the child could use the laptop like a text book.
- He said one laptop per child could be " very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood".
