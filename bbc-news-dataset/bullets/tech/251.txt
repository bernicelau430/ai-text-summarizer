- Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID).
- The service allows deaf people to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL).
- Deaf person uses a webcam or videophone to connect with a BSL interpreter.
- The interpreter relays the conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.
- UK lags behind other countries in providing relay services at the cost of an ordinary phone call.
- The telecommunications sector is discriminating against sign language users by failing to fund the video relay service.
