- The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force
- UKIF is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily
- A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign
- Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers
- The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site
