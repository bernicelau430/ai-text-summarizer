- Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet "rogue-dialling" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis.
- Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: "Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.
- It has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge.
- The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future.
