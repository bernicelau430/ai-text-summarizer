- An organization has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport.
- Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.
- Motorcycle racer Roy Tansley developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.
- The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal.
- Mr. Tansley's invention saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT.
