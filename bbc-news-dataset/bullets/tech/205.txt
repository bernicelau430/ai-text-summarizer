- Technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.
- The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements.
- It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii.
- Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views.
