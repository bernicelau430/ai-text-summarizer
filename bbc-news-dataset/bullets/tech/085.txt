- The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that.
- Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures.
- It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them.
- ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings.
- The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection.
