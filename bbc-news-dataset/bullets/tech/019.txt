- Intel scientists have overcome a problem that prevented silicon from generating and amplifying laser light.
- Silicon can now be used to make components that carry and process light in the form of data pulses.
- The structure of silicon causes electrons to be ripped off atoms when laser light passes through it.
- The Intel researchers found a way to suck away these electrons and enable silicon to generate and amplify laser light.
- Telecommunications equipment that amplifies laser light is currently expensive due to the exotic materials used.
- Silicon is a better amplifier of light pulses than the material used in fiber optic cables.
