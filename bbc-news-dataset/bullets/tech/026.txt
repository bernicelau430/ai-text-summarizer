- Spamhaus warns of a novel virus that hides the origins of junk mail by routing it via mail servers of net service firms.
- This technique could allow spammers to operate with less fear of being caught.
- Blocking all mail from net firms is impractical.
- 90% of junk mail filtered by Brightmail (a Symantec subsidiary) is spotted without looking at net addresses.
- Filtering out emails with web links can stop about 75% of spam.
- If unchecked, the sheer volume of junk mail could overwhelm legitimate email.
