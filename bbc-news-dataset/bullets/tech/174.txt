- Apple has traditionally done well in the market that the Mac mini is aimed at, said Mr Fogg, who also expected many PC makers to release copycat devices in reaction.
- He said anyone wanting to use the Mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.
- "It's a particularly good price when you see that it's Apple that is doing it," he said.
- Although the Mac mini was very cheap for an Apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many PCs.
- The Mac mini has been welcomed by Apple fans, industry experts and PC users.
