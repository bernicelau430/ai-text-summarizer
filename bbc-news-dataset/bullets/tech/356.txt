- An organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport
- Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident
- The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level
- Mr Tansley's invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing
