- France has launched its digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service, called TNT.
- DTT will initially be free-to-air, with pay-TV channels added later.
- Up to 15 pay-TV channels will launch on DTT between September 2005 and March 2006.
- TNT expects 700,000 to one million DTT set-top boxes to be sold in 2005.
- Almost 60% of UK households have gone digital via cable, satellite, or Freeview.
- Freeview was more popular than Sky in the UK.
- 70% of people interviewed were aware of DTT, and 25% planned to buy a digital receiver.
- Digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from 70 euros.
- Free DTT could slow the growth of pay-TV in France.
- France hopes to emulate the success of the UK's Freeview.
