- Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing.
- Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for.
- The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console.
- This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future.
- Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second.
- Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.
