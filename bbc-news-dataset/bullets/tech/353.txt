- A special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed.
- About three million Britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the UK National Tremor Foundation.
- People with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen.
