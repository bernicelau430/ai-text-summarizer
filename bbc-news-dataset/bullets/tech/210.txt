- A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code.
- Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus.
- Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to.
- The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail.
- Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down.
