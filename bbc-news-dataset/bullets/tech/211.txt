- As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.
- Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests.
- Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts.
- The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is "wishful thinking", the report concludes.
- Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it.
- Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem.
- The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain.
