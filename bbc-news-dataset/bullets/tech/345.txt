- Film studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld.
- Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March.
- People who buy the UMD would not have bought it on DVD.
- When we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go.
