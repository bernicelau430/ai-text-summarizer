- With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service.
- The BBC recognizes that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it.
- The corporation's Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).
- Delivering TV over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.
