- Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes.
- The service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes.
- It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips.
- It only searches US channel content currently.
- Results will include programme and episode information like channel, date and time.
- It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.
