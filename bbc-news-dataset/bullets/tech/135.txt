- GTA: San Andreas for the PlayStation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach
- It builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the Driv3r and True Crime-shaped opposition.
- San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.
- The basic gameplay remains familiar.
- The setting is the fictional US state of San Andreas, comprising three major cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas
- CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane.
