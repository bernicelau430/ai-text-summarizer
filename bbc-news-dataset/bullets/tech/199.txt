- Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people.
- The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might.
- Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities.
- Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach.
