- The Committee to Protect Bloggers is asking bloggers to dedicate their sites on 22 February to "Free Mojtaba and Arash Day".
- The Committee was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins.
- The goal is to raise awareness of the plight of imprisoned Iranian bloggers Mojtaba and Arash.
- Bloggers are encouraged to write to local Iranian embassies.
- The Committee aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues.
- It will operate as a non-for-profit organization.
- The blogsphere is doubling every five months.
- If you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one.
