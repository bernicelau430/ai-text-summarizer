- BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams.
- Rogue diallers hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on.
- Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives.
- BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem.
- An early warning system will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills.
- From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's 
- The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.
- It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers.
