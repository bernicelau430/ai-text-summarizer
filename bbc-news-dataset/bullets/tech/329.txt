- Intel scientists have overcome a fundamental problem preventing silicon from generating and amplifying laser light.
- Silicon has not been successfully used to generate or amplify laser light pulses for long-distance data transmission.
- This work is one of several steps needed to use silicon for components that carry and process light as data pulses.
- The structure of silicon causes colliding photons to rip electrons off atoms when laser light passes through, creating a cloud that absorbs the light.
- The researchers found a way to suck away these errant electrons, enabling silicon to both generate and amplify laser light.
- Telecommunications equipment using exotic materials like gallium arsenide to amplify laser light is very expensive.
- Silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the material used in fiber optic cables.
