- Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.
- Apple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the Asteroid music product and leaking them to the PowerPage, Apple Insider and Think Secret websites.
- The Electronic Frontier Foundation is planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and US federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.
- Apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers' net providers.
