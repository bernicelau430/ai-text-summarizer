- Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.
- But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.
- This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables.
- Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.
