- A next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost.
- Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006.
- The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months.
- Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war.
- The format would have a 47% share of DVD content if Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too.
