- A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system
- The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'
- Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF
- But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily
