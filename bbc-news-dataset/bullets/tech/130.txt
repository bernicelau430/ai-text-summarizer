- Sony PlayStation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with UK gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.
- The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
- The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.
- The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate.
- Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.
