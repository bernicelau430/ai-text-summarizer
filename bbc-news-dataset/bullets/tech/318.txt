- Ask Jeeves acquired Bloglines but it was not revealed how much they paid.
- Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web.
- Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.
- There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines.
- It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates.
- Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information rather than helping them write it.
- The acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.
