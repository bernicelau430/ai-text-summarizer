- The EU's Lifeplus project aims to replace audio tours with computer-generated images that bring historical sites to life
- The technology combines digital people and computer-generated elements with the actual view seen by tourists
- The camera captures the view and feeds it to software that combines the viewpoint with animated virtual elements
- Visitors could see life as it was originally lived in places like Pompeii
- The software interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements
