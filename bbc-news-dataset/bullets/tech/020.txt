- Microsoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser (IE 7).
- This decision is seen as a U-turn, as Microsoft previously saw no need to update the browser.
- The move is to compete with rivals such as Firefox and Opera.
- IE 7 will be less vulnerable to bugs that make the current browser a target for criminals.
- Test versions of IE 7 are due to be released by the summer.
- The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old and seen as falling behind rivals.
- Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch security holes in IE 6.
- A security bulletin was recently released to patch eight critical security holes in IE.
