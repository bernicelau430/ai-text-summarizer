- About 20,000 people have been banned from playing the Half-Life 2 game.
- Half-Life 2 was officially released on 16 November but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.
- Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.
- Valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false.
