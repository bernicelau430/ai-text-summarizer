- Lycos Europe's campaign against spam-related websites has been put on hold.
- The action is in response to spammers redirecting traffic back to the Lycos screensaver site.
- The site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words "Stay tuned".
- The idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers.
- People were encouraged to download the screensaver to send data to spam sites when their PC was idle.
