- Ask Jeeves acquired Bloglines not just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world.
- Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.
- The acquisition will sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service, letting people customize their web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.
