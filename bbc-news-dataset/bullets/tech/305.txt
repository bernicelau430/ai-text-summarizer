- The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin soon with Virgin Radio.
- Nokia has been working on Visual Radio, which takes an FM signal and enables stations to add information and pictures.
- Visual Radio is not television but an evolution providing tools for people to participate in radio more easily.
- The visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station.
- When you hear an artist you don't know or there's a competition, you can turn on a visual channel parallel to the broadcast.
- Visual Radio content is transmitted by GPRS, so you need that service enabled.
- There's also the ability to interact with the radio station, similar to digital television's red button content.
- Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.
- Initially, Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets, but other manufacturers may join if successful.
