- The New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) project aims to develop a new media genre allowing audiences to create their own media worlds.
- The three-year project will develop software tools for viewers to edit content to their needs.
- One production will be an experimental TV show driven by text messages from the audience.
- The tools will obey complex rules of cinematography and editing.
- Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots, and even the sets and props of TV shows.
