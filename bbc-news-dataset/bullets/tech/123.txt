- The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons
- The blocking began early on Monday
- The blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack
- Policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website
- There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site.
