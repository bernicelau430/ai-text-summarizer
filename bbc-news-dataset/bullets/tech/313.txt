- Hollywood is preparing for the high-definition revolution in home entertainment.
- What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.
- High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike.
- High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than current DVDs.
- It will take time to persuade people to buy different players and displays for high-definition DVDs.
- On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier because less compression is needed.
- An entire DVD project can currently take up to three months.
- Currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression.
- The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master.
- Data rates currently run at about 1.2 gigabits per second when mastering movies.
- High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes.
- Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD.
- If studios do focus on delivering more added value content, they will ultimately want more money for it.
- Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD.
