- A fake website is trying to cash in on the tsunami disaster.
- Spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating shortly after the domain name was registered.
- DEC hopes to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible.
- Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard.
- DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm.
- DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation.
- None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records.
- All attempts to contact the people behind the site have failed.
- BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down.
- The web address of the fake site is decuk.org, which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people.
