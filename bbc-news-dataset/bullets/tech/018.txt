- Old-fashioned audio tours of historical places could be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life
- The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists
- The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements
- Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements
