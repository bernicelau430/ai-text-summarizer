- Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993.
- For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK.
- Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise.
- The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York.
- Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.
- The phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on.
- The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985.
- When phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.
- In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset.
- Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone.
