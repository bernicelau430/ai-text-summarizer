- A new EU project may replace audio tours with computer-generated images that bring historical sites to life
- Visitors would see people going about their daily life, for example in Pompeii
- The technology combines digital and real views
- The camera captures the view and feeds it to software
- Software combines the visitor's viewpoint with animated virtual elements
- The project is driven by a new desire to bring the past to life
