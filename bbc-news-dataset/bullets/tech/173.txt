- The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine.
- DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.
- IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance.
- The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October.
- By 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing.
- One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing is health.
- He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding.
- The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second).
