- A 2.5 gigapixel image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps.
- The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO.
- The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003.
- The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures.
- The finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras.
- Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite.
- That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs.
