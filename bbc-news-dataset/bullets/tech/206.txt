- The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million
- BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter
- Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km
