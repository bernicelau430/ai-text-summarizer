- Argonaut Games, one of Britain's largest independent game makers, has been put up for sale
- Selling Argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash
- The company was behind the Harry Potter games
- The company warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended
- Staff were told job losses were necessary to save the company from going under
- New deals were further delayed, leading Argonaut to warn in mid-October that it was running out of cash
- "A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time"
