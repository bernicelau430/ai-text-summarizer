- US rapper Snoop Dogg has been sued for $25m by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.
- The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies.
- The woman said she was assaulted after a recording of the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show on the ABC network in 2003.
- The rapper's spokesman said the allegations were untrue and the woman was misusing the legal system as a means of extracting financial gain.
- The rapper's spokesperson said: Snoop will have the opportunity to prove in a court of law that [the alleged victim] is opportunistic and deceitful.
- ABC said the claims had no merit.
