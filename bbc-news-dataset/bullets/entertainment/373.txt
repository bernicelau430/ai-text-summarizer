- Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair.
- The book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp.
- This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film.
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India.
