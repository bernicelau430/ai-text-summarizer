- U2 is determined to remain the biggest band in the world.
- The band aims to be "bigger and bolder and better," creating music that resonates globally, according to Bono.
- U2 has won three Grammy Awards for their hit "Vertigo."
- The end of the decade was a crucial point; having reached the top, they sought new challenges.
- In 1987, "The Joshua Tree" broke sales records with hits like "Where the Streets Have No Name" and "With Or Without You."
- U2's stadium-filling sound was the goal from the beginning; "War" achieved breakthrough success in the UK and US.
- The band explored different rock branches, electronic dance music, and extravagant stage shows while maintaining mass appeal.
- "Vertigo" debuted at number one in the UK, their 26th top 10 hit.
- Early songs like "Sunday Bloody Sunday" gave them a political image, which Bono rejected.
- Before "How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb," U2 sold 125 million albums worldwide.
