- A film based on the internet musings of the Baghdad Blogger has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.
- The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh's film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears.
- The film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war.
- Director Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building.
