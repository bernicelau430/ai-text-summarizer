- Pete Doherty was involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.
- Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist.
- Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail.
- He is out on Â£50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.
