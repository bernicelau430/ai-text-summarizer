- U2 wants to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it.
- According to Q magazine, the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world.
- Bono says the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better, to make records the whole world will listen to.
- The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements.
- In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers.
- U2's aim from the start was the stadium-filling, anthemic sound.
- War, their third album, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US.
- Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.
- Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world.
- Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.
- Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.
