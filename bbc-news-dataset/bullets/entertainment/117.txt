- Johnny Depp is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents.
- But it was TV that first made Depp a star.
- In 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street.
- Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits.
- He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton.
