- Head of St Fintian's school complains about Brian McFadden's video.
- The video implies McFadden attended and was abused at the school.
- McFadden claims he was beaten at his own school in the song's lyrics.
- Reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental, they say.
- Corporal punishment was outlawed in Irish schools in 1982.
- St Fintian's High School says it's clearly identified in the video.
- McFadden never went there.
