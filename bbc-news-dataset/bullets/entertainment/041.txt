- British musicians are at a disadvantage compared to US musicians, according to Nigel McCune of the Musicians' Union.
- The Music Managers' Forum (MMF) supports the Musicians' Union, stating that British artists face "an uphill struggle" to succeed in the US due to tough visa requirements.
- Visa regulations are blamed for hindering British acts' chances of success in the US music market.
- McCune highlights the "creaky bureaucracy" as an issue that needs to be addressed to help British acts maintain momentum in the US.
- The cost for a singer to obtain a visa to perform in the US is approximately $1,300 (Â£680).
