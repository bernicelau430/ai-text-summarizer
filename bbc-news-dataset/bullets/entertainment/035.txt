- The Sound of Music will be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film's release.
- The musical is based on the von Trapp family who escaped Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.
- Sensitivities about Nazism and issues towards the von Trapp family may explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.
- The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.
- The song was an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein.
