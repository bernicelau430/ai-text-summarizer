- The original stage production of The Sound of Music is to be performed for the first time in the Austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.
- The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.
- Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.
