- Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair.
- Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray had seen the world.
- As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider.
- Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film's second half.
- Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish.
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India.
- She cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors, she said.
- They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.
- This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film.
