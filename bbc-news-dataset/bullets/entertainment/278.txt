- Download formats will now be included in the Official UK Singles Chart.
- The inclusion of downloaded music in the official singles chart has been delayed for a month.
- The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 March.
- But the date has been put back to 17 April to create a "level playing field" for independent labels.
- BPI chairman Peter Jamieson said: The inclusion of download formats in the Official UK Singles Chart is the most significant development in the charts for 20 years.
