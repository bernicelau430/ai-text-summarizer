- Snoop Dogg is being sued for $25m (Â£13m) by a make-up artist who claimed he and his entourage drugged and raped her two years ago.
- ABC said the claims had "no merit".
- The rapper's spokesman said the allegations were "untrue" and the woman was "misusing the legal system as a means of extracting financial gain".
- The woman waited two years to sue because she was trying to negotiate a settlement with the media companies.
- The rapper's spokesperson said: "Snoop will have the opportunity to prove in a court of law that [the alleged victim] is opportunistic and deceitful."
