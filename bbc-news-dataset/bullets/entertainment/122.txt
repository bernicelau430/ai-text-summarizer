- The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004.
- Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year, compared with 45 in 2003.
- The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production.
- It was too early to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said.
- Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK.
- The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004.
- The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.
- It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.
