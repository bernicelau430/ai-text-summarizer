- Mira Nair thrilled to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair.
- Focus Features offered Nair Vanity Fair after distributing Monsoon Wedding.
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India.
- Nair defended casting American Reese Witherspoon as Becky Sharp.
- Filming tricks helped the film.
- The book is one of the classics of English literature.
- Nair jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style.
- She also cast intuitively - in my films she cast as many non-actors as I cast actors.
- "They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India."
- "First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in," she said.
- "As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider."
- "It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said 'knock her up, won't you, I need some flesh on the girl'," she joked.
- This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film.
