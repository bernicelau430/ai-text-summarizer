- Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair
- Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray had seen the world
- Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India
- This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film
