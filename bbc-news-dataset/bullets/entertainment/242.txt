- The Sound of Music is to be performed in Austria for the first time, 40 years after the film's release.
- The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who escaped Nazi-occupied Austria.
- The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s.
- Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical.
