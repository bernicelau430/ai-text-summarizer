- Indian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life
- Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world
- Nair said: "First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in"
- "It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding," Nair told BBC World Service's Masterpiece programme
- Nair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish
- But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India
- Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film's second half
- "They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India."
- "I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors," she said
- Nair: "It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said 'knock her up, won't you, I need some flesh on the girl'," she joked
- "This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film."
