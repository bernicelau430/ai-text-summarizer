- Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair
- Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray had seen the world
- Nair defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp
- The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India
- Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has made in a Bollywood style
- As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider.
- The book is one of the classics of English literature
