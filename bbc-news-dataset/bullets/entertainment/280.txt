- The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show.
- Conti told the show's director that we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or I'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes.
- The orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches.
- Conti immediately told the show's director to do something.
