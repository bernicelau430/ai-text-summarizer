- The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected.
- The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production.
- Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK.
- It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.
