- Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band's guitarist at their biggest gig to date.
- Babyshambles, formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday.
- Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines' second album.
- Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies.
- Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail.
- The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden.
- Babyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London's Brixton Academy on Tuesday.
- He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.
