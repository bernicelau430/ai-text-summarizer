- The number of British films produced in the UK fell by 40% in 2004.
- According to Screen Daily, films starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law were among those affected.
- The UK Film Council attributed the drop to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production.
- Closure of film tax loopholes and the strength of the pound against the dollar also contributed.
- The UK Film Council is scheduled to announce a replacement for the UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.
- Co-production of films and changes to financing arrangements also factored into the reduction.
