- The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004
- It was too early to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005
- Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK
- The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production
- The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004
