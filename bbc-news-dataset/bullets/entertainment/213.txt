- Johnny Depp is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents.
- He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring.
- His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie's relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children.
- Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits.
