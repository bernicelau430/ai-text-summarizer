- Johnny Depp is celebrated as one of Hollywood's most maverick talents.
- In 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street.
- Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone's Vietnam epic Platoon.
- His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie's relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children.
- The theme of children's literature in Depp's career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl's classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
- Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994.
- He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring.
