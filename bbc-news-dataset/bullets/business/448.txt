- Australian airline Qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.
- During the first six months of the fiscal year, Qantas made savings of A$245m, and is on track to top its target of A$500m for the full year.
- Sales will dip by at least A$30m after the Indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, Qantas said.
- Qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half.
- Last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out Australia, with Mr Dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain "all-Australian".
- Qantas boss Mr Dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures.
