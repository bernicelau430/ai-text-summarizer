- The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions.
- Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation.
- Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry by the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.
- Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out.
- Prosecutors allege that Marsh and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.
- The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks.
