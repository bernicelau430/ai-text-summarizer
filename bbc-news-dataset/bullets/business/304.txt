- Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say.
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse.
- Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.
- Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.
