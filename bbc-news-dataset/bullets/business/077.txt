- China lent Russia $6bn to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos.
- Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.
- Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.
- The $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks.
- Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China.
  - Deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.
  - Companies have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries.
- CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead.
- Deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy.
