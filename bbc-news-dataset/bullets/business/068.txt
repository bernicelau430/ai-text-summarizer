- Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of investments agreed to a compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA)
- Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service
- Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added
- This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome
