- Shifting Saab production to the US could reduce losses due to its popularity as an upmarket European car.
- The Cadillac BLS will be built at Saab's loss-making factory in Sweden to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.
- The Cadillac BLS will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine, aimed at appealing to European drivers.
- The decision to build Cadillac in Sweden reflects Saab's failure to penetrate the European luxury car market significantly.
- Building Cadillac in Sweden aims to introduce scale to the Saab factory, which produces fewer than 130,000 cars annually.
- The move is part of GM's effort to promote Cadillac as an alternative luxury brand in Europe.
- Moving production to the US would reduce exposure to the weak US dollar, making Saabs more affordable for US consumers.
