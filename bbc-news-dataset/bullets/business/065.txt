- European Union finance ministers meet on Thursday to discuss proposals to boost development aid for poorer nations.
  - Including a tax on jet fuel
- Airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.
- At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.
- There is thought to be widespread support for the plan from EU ministers.
- Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the EU said.
  - Any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development
