- The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline.
- However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution.
- The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government.
- Brazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline.
- On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992.
