- Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.
- The service, launched in December and dubbed "Otoku" or "bargain", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said.
- The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.
