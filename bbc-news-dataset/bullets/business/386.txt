- Marsh posted a $676m (£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (£195.3m) profit a year before.
- "Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history," Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.
- As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m.
- In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers.
