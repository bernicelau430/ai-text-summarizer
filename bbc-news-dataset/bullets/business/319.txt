- Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid.
- Euronext said it could not guarantee "at this stage" that a firm offer would be made for LSE.
- A deal with Euronext could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.
- Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue.
