- The European Commission has launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.
- Both the Italian government and Alitalia deny the money is state aid.
- Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997.
- Eight of Alitalia's rivals brought the matter to the Commission's attention, including Lufthansa, British Airways, and Iberia.
- EU regulations stipulate governments may help companies financially only on the same terms as a commercial investor.
