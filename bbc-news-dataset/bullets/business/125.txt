- Trade Minister Mark Vaile said the bid may be against the national interest.
- Australian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.
- WMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; Â£550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before.
- Mr Vaile compared Xstrata's attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia's Woodside Petroleum in 2001.
- WMC itself has no objection in principle to being bought out as long as the price is right.
- WMC spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target.
