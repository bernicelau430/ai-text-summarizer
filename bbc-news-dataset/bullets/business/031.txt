- Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.
- These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730.
- The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.
- BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium.
