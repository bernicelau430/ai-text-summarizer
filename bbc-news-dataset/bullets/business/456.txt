- Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange.
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse.
- The 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about Â£1.35bn.
- The LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had "been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented".
- Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.
- Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.
- While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs.
