- French stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against Vivendi Universal, its boss, and another top executive.
- AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel.
- It believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information.
- Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was public knowledge.
- Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing.
