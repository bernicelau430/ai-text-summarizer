- The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%.
- Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August.
- CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises.
- The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labor market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity.
- The EEF said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future.
- So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing.
- Manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.
- Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods.
- Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.
