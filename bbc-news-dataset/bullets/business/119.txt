- The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.
- Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.
- Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.
- Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.
- The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was "concerned by the clamour in some quarters" for early interest rate increases.
- Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.
