- The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%.
- This is the first upwards move in more than a year.
- The Bank said it acted to curb inflation, but some analysts criticized the move.
- Opposition parties said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% annually.
- The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30-year low.
