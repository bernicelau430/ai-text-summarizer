- Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.
- On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%.
- It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs.
- But the figures are embarrassing for the government.
