- Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse, valued at about Â£1.35bn.
- The LSE said the bid was undervalued and there was no assurance any transaction could be successfully implemented.
- Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe.
- Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.
- Euronext appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors last week.
- While Mr. Seifert suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt raised concerns about potential job losses.
