- The UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
- Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: "This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy."
- And he said the GDP figures may help to "push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve".
- The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003.
