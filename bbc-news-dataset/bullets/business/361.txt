- Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse
- Last week the LSE said the bid undervalued and advised "that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented"
- Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake
- Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors
