- A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.
- The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave "protected designation of origin" status to feta cheese made in Greece.
- The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name.
- The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.
