- UK Coal said it was making significant progress in shaking up the business.
- The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold.
- The company hopes to return to profit in 2006.
- Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule.
- The company said actions should significantly uplift earnings.
- UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.
