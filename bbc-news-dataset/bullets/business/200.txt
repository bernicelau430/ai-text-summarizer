- Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy.
- All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will be subject to a 10% tax.
- The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy.
- The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading.
- The measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.
