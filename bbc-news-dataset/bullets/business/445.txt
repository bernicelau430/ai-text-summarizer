- The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline.
- The airline could win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government.
- On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m), after ruling in favor of its compensation claim against the government.
- An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances.
