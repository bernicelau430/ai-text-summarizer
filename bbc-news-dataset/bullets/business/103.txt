- Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said that 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history.
- Marsh said it had signed a letter of intent, but did not say when the move would take place.
- An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.
- The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars.
- Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers in an effort to reform its business practices.
- As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m.
- Marsh posted a $676m loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m profit a year before.
- Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter.
