- In sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place.
- The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.
- The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months.
