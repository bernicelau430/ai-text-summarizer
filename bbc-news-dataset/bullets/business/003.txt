- Menatep Group will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.
- State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn.
- The sale was forced by Russia to settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.
- The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.
- The company intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk.
- Pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets.
