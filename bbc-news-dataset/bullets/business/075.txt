- European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.
- Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting.
- The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines.
- EU was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the "competitiveness of the airlines".
