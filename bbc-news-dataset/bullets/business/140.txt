- Shares in steel firms have dropped worldwide amid concerns that higher iron ore costs will hit profit growth.
- Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD's price rise was "uncharted territory".
- Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China.
- The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world's biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices.
