- A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.
- The German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros from 2.4bn euros in 2003.
- For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros.
- The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range.
- Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.
- Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year.
