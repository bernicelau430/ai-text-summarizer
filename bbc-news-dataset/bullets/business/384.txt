- The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline, Varig.
- Brazil's airport authority chief, Carlos Wilson, had claimed the government was on the brink of intervening.
- An intervention would mean the government taking administrative control of the company and its finances.
- However, the country's vice president, Jose Alencar, has said the government is still looking for a solution.
- The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government.
- The courts awarded Varig 2bn reais ($725m) after ruling in its favor against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992.
