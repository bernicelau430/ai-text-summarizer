- Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse.
- Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.
- While Mr. Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs.
