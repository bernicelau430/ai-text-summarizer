- Deloitte warns that 10 years of "golden" economic performance may end in 2005 with growth slowing.
- Deloitte forecasts economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%.
- Robust household spending growth, the main driver of the economy, is likely to suffer.
- This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year's 3.25%.
- Economic growth will be constrained by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes.
