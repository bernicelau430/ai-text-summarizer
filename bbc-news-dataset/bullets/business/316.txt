- Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
- Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from Deutsche Boerse.
- The 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about Â£1.35bn.
- LSE said the bid was undervalued and there was no assurance any transaction could be implemented.
- Euronext has a quarter stake in Clearnet, which clears trades on the LSE.
- Euronext already has a presence in London through its acquisition of Liffe.
- Euronext appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors.
- Seifert suggested a merged company would be run out of London, but Frankfurt mayor raised concerns about job losses.
