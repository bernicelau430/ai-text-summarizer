- BMW has announced £100m of new investment in the Mini.
- Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.
- Mini Convertible costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.
- The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.
- BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium.
- Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.
