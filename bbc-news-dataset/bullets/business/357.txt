- The Open Society Institute (OSI), financed by George Soros, has accused Kazakhstan officials of trying to close down its local office.
- The OSI shut its office in Moscow last year and has withdrawn from Uzbekistan and Belarus.
- Insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offense in Kazakhstan.
- This legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force Soros Foundation-Kazakhstan to cease its activities in Kazakhstan.
- Since the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazakhstan has been dominated by its president Nursultan Abish-uly Nazarbayev.
- The organization has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple Georgia's former president.
