- US tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers.
- Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal.
- The ruling dramatically transforms the government's lawsuit.
- The government now must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behavior in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.
- The government had claimed tobacco firms:
  - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction
  - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns
  - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.
