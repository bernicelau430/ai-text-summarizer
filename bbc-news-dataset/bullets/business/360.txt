- Deloitte warned that ten years of "golden" economic performance may end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly
- Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%
- The UK economy had enjoyed a "golden period" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s
- Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes
- "Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace."
- "This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%"
