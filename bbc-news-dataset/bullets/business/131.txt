- The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.
- The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares.
- Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.
- He said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.
