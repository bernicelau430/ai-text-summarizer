- A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (Â£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.
- The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.
- According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an "unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom.
