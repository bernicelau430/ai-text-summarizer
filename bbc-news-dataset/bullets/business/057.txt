- Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.
- The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.
- Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal.
- Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%.
