- Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, the first upwards move in over a year
- The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation
- Opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis
- The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30-year low
- Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy
